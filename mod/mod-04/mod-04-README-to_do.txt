GETTING STARTED
1.  Enter the command "bash build.sh; bash server.sh".
2.  Open your web browser to the appropriate URL to view your app locally.
3.  Start a second terminal tab for entering additional commands.
4.  Start a BitBucket repository for your new app, and push your new app into that repository.
5.  Deploy this app.  Instructions on doing this are at https://dev.to/lauragift21/build-a-static-site-with-hugo-and-deploy-with-netlify-35a6.
6.  Add a continuous integration badge for the build.  (NOTE: I prefer Semaphore CI, located at https://semaphoreci.com/.)
7.  Customize the README.md file and everything else in this app.  View, test, update, and deploy it frequently.
