GETTING STARTED
1.  Enter the command "bash build.sh; bash server.sh".
2.  Open your web browser to the appropriate URL (http://localhost:1313) to view your app locally.
3.  Start a second terminal tab for entering additional commands.
4.  Start a GitHub, BitBucket, or GitLab repository for your new app, and push your new app into that repository.
5.  Deploy this app.  Instructions on doing this are at https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/.
    To save time, you may skip adding the netlify.toml file.
